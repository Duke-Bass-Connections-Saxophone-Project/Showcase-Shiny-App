# Background on the background:
## 20th century jazz saxophone mouthpieces
The height of American jazz saxophone manufacture and playing occurred from the dawn of modern recording to the dawn of the electric guitar as the dominant popular solo instrument, c.1930-1968. The most desirable instruments and mouthpieces to this day were produced in this era of maximum profitability in saxophone production. The classic American jazz sound is a product of the style of the era but also to a lesser extent to the instruments of the era. It is generally accepted that the most important component of saxophone tonal quality is the players embouchure, or the shape and muscle tone of lips, teeth, and oral cavity. As this tone is produced by the reed and mouthpiece and travels down the instrument to create the pitch the influence on tone decreases. Hence the next most important aspect on tone quality after the player is the reed and mouthpiece, followed by the neck and finally the body of the saxophone.

Top quality saxophones of the era are highly sought after by today’s professionals, dominated by a few models known to be played by the legendary innovators. Since the mouthpiece is generally regarded as more important in the development of tone, vintage mouthpieces are also highly sought after, but finding a top quality vintage piece similar to pieces played by legends of the era is much more complicated and subjective due to the following factors:

1.	The mouthpiece and reed work as a system with the players embouchure, so that an identical mouthpiece used by a different player produces a distinct tone, even among peer professionals.  Changing reeds to a different strength or profile also significantly changes the tone for the same player and mouthpiece.

2.	Most professional players use mouthpieces that have been custom made or custom modified for them by the mouthpiece manufacturer or and aftermarket craftsperson referred to as a “refacer”. As a result, purchasing a manufacturer’s stock mouthpiece of the same size designation and era as one known to be played by a past pro is unlikely to the same dimensionally, sometimes drastically so. Some professionals made their own modifications, and documentation of this modification process was either poorly recorded or regarded as secret, or both and hence has been lost to history.

3.	Mouthpieces are wear items. Teeth dig into the bite plate, the vibration of the reed on the side and tip rails slowly erode, and dropping or bumping the mouthpiece can easily chip or deform the tip areas, which are the most critical areas to tone production. Any professional’s personal favorite mouthpiece is significantly worn in and different dimensionally than a new mouthpiece, and could potentially be “worn-in” to a preferred state from playing.

4.	Mouthpieces are more difficult to track from historical photographs. Mouthpieces that look identical for the outside can be significantly different on the inside, and the inside form is what is responsible for tone production.

5.	Most mouthpieces do not include a date traceable serial number, and most prominent manufacturers have produced mouthpieces over several decades that have changed little in physical appearance but have changed drastically in quality and value.

6.	There is some variability from the factory of nominally identical mouthpieces. Modern manufacturing techniques have abated this issue somewhat for professional grade mouthpieces, but the best are still generally hand finished. In the past this variability led to a practice of test playing several mouthpieces of the same make and model at the manufacturer or retailer, then purchasing and/or requesting minor modifications at the point of sale. Due to modern internet marketing this practice is increasingly difficult but still employed by some.

In spite of the difficulties noted above, several makes of vintage mouthpieces have gained cult following among modern professionals, and command a premium price over new equivalents. In most cases the collectable vintage mouthpieces are still in production, but are of inferior quality.

# Materials and Manufacturing Technique
The material of choice for professional saxophone mouthpieces is either hard rubber or brass. Typically, hard rubber is used for classical and a dark, cool, jazz tone. Brass is typically associated with a brighter edgier tone used for modern jazz and rock/fusion/funk etc. but there are also many counter examples of usage. 
Hard rubber is produced by compounding latex derived from the rubber tree plant sap and sulfur, then compressing at elevated temperature to “vulcanize”. This process is the same used for automotive tire rubber, but the amount of sulfur and baking time and temperature is higher to produce a much harder material. Chemical additives further modify the vulcanization rate as a function of temperature and pressure. Fillers can also be added to modify the final color and mechanical properties  and/or reduce required curing time.
As the processing of natural latex and additives have evolved industrially, the exact makeup of hard rubber has evolved in the last century. It is not clear if this makes a significant difference in the sound and feel of the saxophone mouthpiece.
Hard rubber mouthpieces were originally molded in solid rod stock then machined. Most valuable vintage and modern hard rubber mouthpieces are molded into a blank mouthpiece form then hand finished. 
Brass mouthpieces are machined from bar stock. Sometimes this machining is done in 2 halves and then soldered or brazed together. After final machining and hand finishing the brass is typically silver and or gold plated to prevent corrosion and discoloration.
The makeup of brass (Copper +Zinc) changes over time due to commodity pricing, generally decreasing in Copper content over time. Additives to aid in machinability, notably Lead, can be present at up to 3% by weight.

# Quality control and key dimensions.
The most basic dimension for a saxophone mouthpiece is the tip opening. A make and model typically are offered in a range of tip openings as the only optional dimension, and the mouthpieces are marked with a number denoting the tip opening size. A classical or beginning player typically uses a smaller tip opening, advanced jazz players use medium to medium large tip openings, and rock players use large tip openings. This is only generally true, as other dimensions of the mouthpiece influence the desired tip opening. For tenor saxophones tip openings vary generally 0.060-0.140”, with 0.070-0.120” being a more typical range. For an individual make and model the tip openings move in steps of 0.005” or so, but there is not a uniform standard.
The next most common measurement is the facing curve. This is generally not available from the manufacturer but is cataloged individually by refacers and manufacturers. This curve is generally regarded as the most important differentiator between mouthpieces. The most common method for measurement is referred to as the Brand system after Eric Brand. This method consists of measuring the depth at contact of a feeler gauge on a calibrated glass plate. 
Chamber size is sometimes offered as an option of small, medium, or large from the manufacturer, but is difficult to quantify with standard tooling. Chamber shape can also vary significantly between rectangular and round.
Sidewall shape can be flat and thick or thin and scooped.
Baffle shape is very critical to sound, but not well quantified. Shapes can vary from “no baffle”, to rollover in several forms, to a “high baffle” design.
Beak shape and size is on the outside of the mouthpiece but effects the player’s jaw position, hence has a different effect for different players.
In summary, the key dimensional factors:
* Tip opening
* Facing curve
* Baffle shape
* Chamber size
* Sidewall shape
* Beak shape and size

# Background
Many professional jazz saxophonists and aspirational amateurs play on vintage mouthpieces produced in the mid-20th century. These mouthpieces are increasingly rare and valuable as a result. Some of these mouthpiece manufacturers are still in production, but the ownership and manufacturing facilities have evolved to reduce costs and are generally regarded as inferior. Boutique makers produce reproductions and some are quite good, but the vintage pieces are still more desirable.
Traditional measurement techniques archive necessary but insufficient detail required to produce a consistent mouthpiece. The “intangibles” have been attributed to many things, but are most likely due to artisan craftsmanship that attains higher precision and repeatability than is easily measured dimensionally, or unique material properties, or a combination of both.
This project will attempt to quantify dimensional and material differences in a sample set of valuable vintage mouthpieces, modern mediocre copies, high quality modern copies, and a few control pieces. The end goal is to build a digital library of iconic classic mouthpieces and the craftsmanship of the great hand finishers, and to reproduce these pieces faithfully using modern precision fabrication techniques.

# Project Description:
The first phase will focus on the comparison of a particularly nice mouthpiece to other nominally similar pieces.
The mouthpieces 
1.	J&D Hite Premiere: This is a modern student grade mouthpiece made of plastic. It is highly regarded as a good starter mouthpiece. This is a control sample mouthpiece.
2.	Theo Wanne Slant Sig2: This is a modern mouthpiece made by one of the most highly regarded modern masters of mouthpiece design and fabrication. The “Slant Sig” refers to a particular era of vintage Otto Link Tone Edge with the Otto Link signature logo printed on a slanted angle. This mouthpiece is marketed as having all of the best characteristics of Theo’s favorite vintage “slat sigs” from his collection and experience, and additionally some Theo Wanne personal touches that make it superior to the original vintage pieces.
3.	New Otto Link Tone Edge (OLTE): This is a relatively inexpensive modern mouthpiece that is branded and looks nominally like a valuable vintage Otto Link Tone Edge, but is not regarded highly by today’s jazz musician.
4.	New Otto Link Tone Edge Slant Signature: This mouthpiece is an attempt by the current owner of the Otto Link brand to bring fans of the vintage mouthpiece back to the modern brand. It is more similar to the vintage mouthpiece, but gets mixed reviews by most accounts.
5.	Jody Jazz HR*: This modern piece is a hybrid of a vintage tribute with some modern power added in. 
6.	Vandoren V16 T8: Vandoren is a popular brand of reed and ligature, and their mouthpieces are generally considered a good value. This piece is the closest reproduction of a vintage OLTE that Vandoren produces per their own advertising copy.
7.	Vintage Otto Link Reso-chamber. This piece was originally produced c.1940-1946, and refaced by Freddie Gregory (d.2014) in the 1990’s for a more modern level of projection and larger tip opening. This is a favorite from Brian’s personal collection, and is highly collectible due to rarity and reputation.
8.	Vintage Otto Lin Reso-chamber. This piece was originally produced c.1940-1946 and as the original “Joe Allard” facing from the factory. This facing is significantly different than a typical collectable vintage jazz piece, and is included as a control. The material, mold shape, and age are identical to mouthpiece ID7.
9.	Vintage OLTE slant signature EG reface. This is a highly desirable and collectable mouthpiece, consisting of a c.1950-1965 mouthpiece expertly opened from an original small tip opening to today’s typical jazz standard of 0.105* by Eric Greiffenhagen.
10.	Ted Klum Tonamax. This mouthpiece is highly regarded as one of the best modern reproductions of a classic OLTE with excellent craftmanship and quality control
11.	D’Addario Select Jazz. This is a new mouthpiece with the design intent of reproducing the best vintage mouthpieces similar to an OLTE with no hand intervention. Each mouthpiece is CNC machined from high quality hard rubber barstock with no hand finishing. This is generally regarded as a good value.

# Anticipated Outcomes
A precise 3D model will be archived of at least 2 great vintage saxophone mouthpieces of the mid-20th century. This model will be compared to other nominally similar pieces. An attempt will be made to quantify the physical differences in dimensions, material composition, and acoustic signature.
Summary of work performed
1.	Mouthpiece archive and reproduction
1.5.	Scan each mouthpiece in the SMIF microCT scanner.
This was a very time consuming process. Some scans failed to compile properly and needed to be repeated several times. In the end useful scans were produced for mouthpiece ID 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11.
1.6.	Convert scans into .STL files that can be analyzed and/or 3D printed.
This was also very tie consuming. In the end Justin Gladman, R&D Engineer at SMIF completed this file conversion for the project due to his easy access to the propriety software and his expertise with this software. STL files were created for mouthpiece ID 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11. Files were created at 2 resolutions, 1 for max fidelity for printing, typically about 1GB, and 1 for easy manipulation for analysis, about 3MB or less.
1.7.	Produce some 3D printed copies.
Copies were produced for ID 1,2,6,7,8. ID 1,2, and 6 have shortened shanks for technical reasons, and are of limited use for evaluation.
1.8.	Test play and hand finish printed copies in an attempt to produce a usable faithful reproduction.
In general, all copies have some similarity with the original from a players perspective, but none would be regarded an exact copy. Mouthpiece ID 7 was printed 5 times while varying some print parameters and hand finishing techniques of careful sanding on table and rails. Mouthpiece ID 7.1 and 7.3 are pretty good mouthpieces, and very similar to the original but still not quite the same in the opinion of the team.
2.	Acoustic data
2.1.	Write a questionnaire and instructions for recording
After much discussion and some trial runs, it was decided to limit the recording to 4 long tones, recorded in 3 takes each for each musician. This resulted in small variations from take to take so eliminated many of the random variations inherent in playing a fragment of a song for example, and it was clear that a time dependent analysis of attack and decay was going to be beyond the scope of this project.
2.2.	Survey musicians and record samples of each musician playing each mouthpiece.
Recordings were collected for the following musicians:
•	Team members Max Bartlett, Matthew Busch, and Gia Jadick.
•	Local professionals Steve Cowles, Dave Finucane, Jill Jones, Matthew Tedesco, and Liam Trawick.
•	Survey responses only were recorded for Brian Curry.
•	Additional recording sessions needed to be cancelled due to COVID-19.
2.3.	Extract a set of parameters from each recording that can be used to quantifiably compare each player-mouthpiece combination.
These parameters were devised and compiled based on online research in the field.
3.	Dimensional analysis
3.1.	Measure physical properties of material of each mouthpiece.
Measurements of material hardness and density could not discern differences between mouthpieces. 
3.2.	Extract key physical dimensions from scanned files in software
A Mathematica script was written to extract tip opening, facing curve, baffle profile, and table angle relative to table for mouthpiece ID 2,5,6,7,8,11.
3.3.	Record measurements by hand using traditional tools.
Traditional measurement tools and techniques were used to record tip opening and facing curve for each mouthpiece.
4.	Comparative analysis
4.1.	Compile all data in a database that allows for easy comparison.
A website interface using R-shiny has been written to dynamically generate plots of datasets
4.2.	Systematically search for correlations in dataset.
Values of R^2, P-values, and slope were compiled for all linear combinations of data sets.
# Conclusions
* The current state of microCT scanning allows for very high resolution 3D digital archiving of vintage hard rubber mouthpieces. This process requires expert knowledge of the microCT scanner and software in order to produce .STL files suitable for printing and analysis.
* 3D printed copies produced on a Formlabs 3D printer make pretty good mouthpieces that are similar to the original, but not functionally exact reproductions of the original, at least not without further method refinement.
* In the recorded data set, there are clear differences between musicians that are greater than the differences between mouthpieces. As expected, the player-mouthpiece system must be considered in all analysis.
* Modern reproductions and adaptations of vintage mouthpieces are also not functionally exact reproductions of vintage mouthpieces. Current 3D printed copies from this study are at least as good if not better than current commercial options at reproducing the feel and sound of a vintage mouthpiece.
