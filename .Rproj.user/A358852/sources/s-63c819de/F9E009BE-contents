# Materials and Manufacturing Technique

<p>
The material of choice for professional saxophone mouthpieces is either hard rubber or brass. Typically, hard rubber is used for classical and a dark, cool, jazz tone. Brass is typically associated with a brighter edgier tone used for modern jazz and rock/fusion/funk etc. but there are also many counter examples of usage.
</p>
<p>
Hard rubber is produced by compounding latex derived from the rubber tree plant sap and sulfur, then compressing at elevated temperature to “vulcanize”. This process is the same used for automotive tire rubber, but the amount of sulfur and baking time and temperature is higher to produce a much harder material. Chemical additives further modify the vulcanization rate as a function of temperature and pressure. Fillers can also be added to modify the final color and mechanical properties  and/or reduce required curing time.
</p>
<p>
As the processing of natural latex and additives have evolved industrially, the exact makeup of hard rubber has evolved in the last century. It is not clear if this makes a significant difference in the sound and feel of the saxophone mouthpiece.
</p>
<p>
Hard rubber mouthpieces were originally molded in solid rod stock then machined. Most valuable vintage and modern hard rubber mouthpieces are molded into a blank mouthpiece form then hand finished. 
</p>
<p>
Brass mouthpieces are machined from bar stock. Sometimes this machining is done in 2 halves and then soldered or brazed together. After final machining and hand finishing the brass is typically silver and or gold plated to prevent corrosion and discoloration.
</p>
<p>
The makeup of brass (Copper +Zinc) changes over time due to commodity pricing, generally decreasing in Copper content over time. Additives to aid in machinability, notably Lead, can be present at up to 3% by weight.
